# Black Hole Orbital Mechanics

**Abstract [(Paper Linked)]**

> In this report, we derive the four types of orbits that appears in the Kepler problem.
We start from the Two-body problem that we transform into a One-body problem with
reduced mass. We then dig into orbits in the Schwarszchild metric where we derive
the geodesics and equation of motion. We provide two proofs of the conservation laws in
which we find values for the energy <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E">
 and angular momentum $L$. We derive the relativistic
potential as well as the location of stable and unstable circular orbits, the innermost stable
circular orbit and the limit of bounded orbits. Finally, we explore briefly the radial infall
motion and we describe in details the derivation of the perihelion advance/relativistic
precession.
